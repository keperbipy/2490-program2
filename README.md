Program 2 - Counting Occurrences of Words
Due Date: Monday, February 22, 11:55pm
Write a program that will take input from a file and will output the number of times that each of the following five strings occurs in the input: There are no trap states or illegal characters. You don't have to worry if extra characters are inserted with the carriage return.

1. settle
2. asset
3. least
4. stale
5. late

The input to your program must come from a file. The file should be a command line argument. The input does not have to be sensible English text. Your program should not be case sensitive (uppercase characters should be treated as their lowercase equivalents)

Sample with program shown from class:

PancakeepeekeEPancakpepepeek
kepepeekepeekancakee panpcakeepeekeepke

Occurrence counts:
pancake count is 1
cake    count is 3
keep    count is 4
peek    count is 5
pep     count is 3

Occurrence counts:

keep    count is 9
peek    count is 3
pep     count is 1

Do not have your program ask for a file name. Use a command-line argument. When your program is finished, submit the .java file on ASULearn. Also, place a copy of your program in your 2490 directory on the student2 machine. I will run your program by typing
java Program2 inputfile
where inputfile is a test file that I will use. Also have a good test input file for your program in your student2 directory. It should show lots of overlapping words so you can make sure that the program is behaving correctly.
